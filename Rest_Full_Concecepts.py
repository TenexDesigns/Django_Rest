Restful Api can be broken down into three concepts

Resources
Resource represenation
Http Methods





In a RESTful API, resources are the fundamental concept around which the API is designed.
A resource is an object or entity that is exposed by the API and can be accessed by a unique URL. 
Examples of resources might include users, products, orders, or blog posts.

Each resource is represented by a resource representation, which is a collection of data that describes the state of the resource at a given point in time.
Resource representations are typically serialized into a format such as JSON or XML so that they can be transmitted over the network.

HTTP methods are used to interact with resources in a RESTful API. The four most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:


GET: Retrieves a representation of a resource. This method is used to read data from the server.

POST: Creates a new resource. This method is used to submit data to the server to create a new resource.

PUT: Updates an existing resource. This method is used to update the state of an existing resource on the server.

DELETE: Deletes a resource. This method is used to delete a resource from the server.




In addition to these four methods, there are several other HTTP methods that can be used in a RESTful API,
including HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, and others. Each of these methods has a specific purpose and can be used to perform different actions on resources.

Overall, the use of resources, resource representations, and HTTP methods is a key part of the design of a RESTful API.
By following the principles of REST, developers can create APIs that are flexible, scalable, and easy to use, 
making it possible to build complex web applications that can be consumed by a wide range of clients.
