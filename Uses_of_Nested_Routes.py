what is the use cases or applications of nested routers in django rest framwork
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Nested routers in Django REST Framework are useful when you have a resource that is related to another resource in a parent-child relationship. 
They allow you to define a nested URL structure that reflects the relationship between the parent and child resources.

Here are a few use cases or applications where nested routers can be useful:

Parent-child relationships:
  When you have resources that are related to each other in a parent-child relationship, 
  nested routers can be used to create URLs that reflect this relationship. For example, a blog post might have comments 
  that are related to it in a parent-child relationship. A nested router can be used to create URLs like /posts/1/comments/2/ to
  represent a specific comment on a specific post.

Multiple levels of nesting:
  Sometimes, you might have resources that are related to each other in multiple levels of parent-child relationships.
  Nested routers can be used to create URLs that reflect these relationships. For example, a book might have chapters, which in turn might have sections.
  A nested router can be used to create URLs like /books/1/chapters/2/sections/3/ to represent a specific section of a specific chapter of a specific book.

Resource filtering:
  Nested routers can be used to filter resources based on their parent-child relationships.
  For example, if you have a blog post with many comments, you might want to only show the comments that belong to a specific post.
  A nested router can be used to create a URL like /posts/1/comments/ that only shows the comments that belong to post number 1.

Overall, nested routers can be a powerful tool for organizing and accessing related resources in Django REST Framework.

Sure! Here's an example of how to use nested routers in Django REST Framework.

Lets say we have two resources: Book and Chapter. Each Chapter belongs to a specific Book. 
  We want to create an API that allows us to view, create, update, and delete both books and chapters, and we want to use nested
  URLs to represent the parent-child relationship between books and chapters.

First, we'll define our serializers:

python
Copy code
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Book, Chapter

class ChapterSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Chapter
        fields = '__all__'

class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    chapters = ChapterSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = '__all__'
        
        
Next, we'll define our viewsets:


from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Book, Chapter
from .serializers import BookSerializer, ChapterSerializer

class BookViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer

class ChapterViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Chapter.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ChapterSerializer
Now, we'll define our URLs using nested routers:


from rest_framework_nested import routers
from .views import BookViewSet, ChapterViewSet

router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'books', BookViewSet)

nested_router = routers.NestedSimpleRouter(router, r'books', lookup='book')
nested_router.register(r'chapters', ChapterViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
    path('', include(nested_router.urls)),
]
In this example, we're using the NestedSimpleRouter class from the rest_framework_nested package to create a nested router.
We're registering the ChapterViewSet with this nested router, and we're using the lookup argument to specify that we want to use the book_pk URL
parameter to look up the parent Book object for the child Chapter objects.

With this setup, we can now access the following URLs:

/books/: List and create books.
/books/1/: Retrieve, update, and delete book with ID 1.
/books/1/chapters/: List and create chapters belonging to book with ID 1.
/books/1/chapters/2/: Retrieve, update, and delete chapter with ID 2, belonging to book with ID 1.
This is just a basic example, but it shows how nested routers can be used to create a URL structure that reflects the 
parent-child relationship between resources.
