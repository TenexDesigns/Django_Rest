In Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), you can use annotations 
to perform calculations or add additional information to querysets. Annotations allow you 
to retrieve and display aggregated or computed values alongside the model data.

To annotate querysets in Django's ORM, you can use the annotate() method of the queryset.
Here's an example to demonstrate how annotations work:

Suppose you have a model called Book with fields title, author, and rating.
You want to annotate the queryset to include the average rating for each author. Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
from django.db.models import Avg
from myapp.models import Book

books = Book.objects.annotate(avg_rating=Avg('rating'))
In the example above, annotate(avg_rating=Avg('rating')) adds a new attribute called avg_rating to each Book object in the queryset. 
The Avg('rating') part calculates the average rating for each author using the rating field.

You can then access the annotated field (avg_rating) just like any other field on the model:

python
Copy code
for book in books:
    print(book.title, book.author, book.avg_rating)
In addition to Avg, Django's ORM provides several other aggregation functions, 
such as Count, Sum, Min, Max, etc. You can use these functions to perform various calculations on your queryset.

Annotations can also be combined with filtering, ordering, and other queryset operations to create complex queries.
Refer to the Django documentation on annotations (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/aggregation/) for more information and additional examples.
