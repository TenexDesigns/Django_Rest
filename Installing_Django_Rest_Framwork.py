To install Django REST framework, you can follow these steps:

1.Activate your virtual environment (if you are using one).

2.Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

3.Run the following command to install Django REST framework:

   pip install djangorestframework


4.After installation is completed, add 'rest_framework' to the INSTALLED_APPS list in your projects settings.py file:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other installed apps
    'rest_framework',
]


5.Optionally, you can also add some additional settings to your projects settings.py file to customize the behavior of Django REST framework.
For example, you can set the default authentication and permission classes:

  
  REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ],
}



6.Finally, run the Django development server using the python manage.py runserver command and start building your API endpoints using Django REST framework.
