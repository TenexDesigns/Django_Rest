When using a ModelViewSet in Django, you can retrieve the ID from the URL in a similar way as with a regular view function.
The ID parameter is automatically added to the views kwargs dictionary by the Django REST framework, and you can access it using the
self.kwargs dictionary in the view.

Here's an example ModelViewSet:


from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import Article
from .serializers import ArticleSerializer

class ArticleViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Article.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ArticleSerializer
In this example, weve defined a ModelViewSet called ArticleViewSet that retrieves all the Article objects from 
the database and uses the ArticleSerializer to serialize the data.

To retrieve the ID parameter from the URL, you can override one of the views methods that access the kwargs dictionary.
For example, you could override the get_object method to retrieve the Article object with the given ID:


class ArticleViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Article.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ArticleSerializer

    def get_object(self):
        queryset = self.get_queryset()
        obj = queryset.get(id=self.kwargs['pk'])
        return obj
In this example, weve overridden the get_object method to retrieve the Article object with the ID specified in the URL.
Weve using the self.kwargs['pk'] syntax to access the pk parameter in the URL, which is automatically added to the kwargs 
dictionary by the Django REST framework. We're then using the get_queryset() method to retrieve the queryset for the view, 
and the queryset.get(id=...) method to retrieve the object with the given ID.

Once youe overridden the get_object method, you can use the self.get_object() method to retrieve the
object with the given ID in other methods of the view.

HOW TO GET THE ID IN A VIEW FROM THE URL

ChatGPT
In Django, you can retrieve the ID from the URL in a view using the kwargs dictionary.
The kwargs dictionary contains the keyword arguments passed to the view function as part of the URL,
and you can access the ID by using the key name that you specified in the URL pattern.

Here's an example URL pattern:


from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('article/<int:pk>/', views.article_detail, name='article_detail'),
]
In this example, the <int:pk> part of the URL pattern specifies that an integer parameter called pk will be passed to the view function.
  We can access the pk parameter in the view function like this:


def article_detail(request, pk):
    # Retrieve the article with the given ID (pk)
    article = Article.objects.get(id=pk)
    # Do something with the article
    # ...
In this example, were defining a view function called article_detail that takes two arguments: request and pk.
The pk argument corresponds to the pk parameter in the URL pattern, and it will contain the ID of the article that we want to retrieve.

Inside the view function, were using the Article.objects.get(id=pk) method to retrieve the article with the given ID,
and then we can use the article object to do whatever we need to do with it.
