It seems that you are encountering an error in Django Rest Framework regarding JSON serialization of a ForeignKey object. This commonly occurs when a serializer is not properly set up to handle ForeignKey relationships between models. In order to resolve this issue, you can use the following approaches:

Approach 1: Nested Serializer
One approach is to use a nested serializer to handle the ForeignKey relationship. This involves creating a serializer for the related model and including it as a field in the main serializer. This way, the related model's data will be properly serialized as a JSON object.

For example, if you have two models, Program and UserProgram, with a ForeignKey relationship:

class Program(models.Model):
    # ...

class UserProgram(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    program = models.ForeignKey(Program, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="program")
You can create serializers like this:

class ProgramSerializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Program
        fields = "__all__"

class UserProgramSerializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    program = ProgramSerializers()
    
    class Meta:
        model = UserProgram
        fields = "__all__"
Here, the UserProgramSerializers includes a nested ProgramSerializers to handle the ForeignKey relationship with the Program model stackoverflow.com.

Approach 2: Custom to_representation Method
Another approach is to override the to_representation method in your serializer to handle the ForeignKey relationship manually. This allows you to control how the related model's data is serialized.

For example, using the same Program and UserProgram models:

class ProgramSerializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Program
        fields = "__all__"

class UserProgramSerializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = UserProgram
        fields = "__all__"

    def to_representation(self, instance):
        response = super().to_representation(instance)
        response['program'] = ProgramSerializers(instance.program).data
        return response
In this case, the to_representation method is overridden to include the serialized data of the related Program model in the response stackoverflow.com.

Both of these approaches can help you resolve the "Object of type ForeignKey is not JSON serializable" error. Choose the one that best fits your use case and requirements.
