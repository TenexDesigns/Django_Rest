But Most of the time, we are not going to use this mixens directly.
Insted, we are going to use Concrete classes that cobine one or more mixens. We call there classes Generic views.
E.g ListCreateAPIView  - That comines two mixens, i.e the ListModelMixen and the CreateModelMixen





THERE ARE ALSO OTHER MIXENS
ListModelMixin
CreateModelMixin
RetrievalModelMixin - For retrieving a single instance of a model
UpdateModelMixin - This iis for updating an instance of a model
DestroyModelMixin - This is for deleting an instance of  a model

EXAMPLE OF A GENRIC VIEW

The ListCreateAPIView has two parents the ListModelMixin,and CreateModelMixin, and the finally it has the GenericAPIView parent,
which is the base class of all generic views
The ListCreateAPIView provides us methods a bunch of methods that we are going to overide in our custom views
e.g get_queryset() - For creating a queryset object
    get_serializer_class() - For specifiying the type of serializer we want to use in our view


class ListCreateAPIView(mixins.ListModelMixin,
                        mixins.CreateModelMixin,
                        GenericAPIView):
    """
    Concrete view for listing a queryset or creating a model instance.
    """
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.list(request, *args, **kwargs)                                    

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)




Note. That the  ListCreateAPIView has both the get and the post methods

The get method has a list options, which it imherits from the ListModelMixin,
The post mehtod has a crete option which it inherits from the .CreateModelMixin,





THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF GENERIC VIEWS

ListAPIView - That has only the listing functionality.
RetrivalAPIView - That has only the retrival functionality 

We also have other generic vies like

RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView 
RettrieveDestroyAPIView 
and many more



HERE IS HOW TO USE THE GENERIC VIEWS
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************8
This code  here is using the ListCreateApiView, where as th eone below it is not, This shows you the power of these Generi views and how they reduce the code

class ProductList(ListCreateAPIView):
      def get_queryset(self):
          return Product.objects.select_related('collection').all()
      def get_serializer_class(self):
          return ProductSerializer
#       # There is alos a method to pass the context
#       def get_serializer_context(self):
#           return {'request':self.request}



This code doesnt use the genenric view.

class ProductList(ListCreateAPIView):
      def get (self,request):
           queryset = Product.objects.select_related('collection')
           serializer = ProductSerializer(queryset, many =True)
           return Response(serializer.data)
      def post(self,request):
           serializer = ProductSerializer(data = request.data)
           serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
           serializer.save()
           print(serializer.data)
           return Response(serializer.data)






These methods are useful if you have some logic or conditions 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class ProductList(ListCreateAPIView):
      def get_queryset(self):
          return Product.objects.select_related('collection').all()
      def get_serializer_class(self):
          return ProductSerializer


But the above code can even be simplyfied some more 


class ProductList(ListCreateAPIView):
      queryset = Product.objects.select_related('collection').all()
      serializer_class = ProductSerializer








GENERIC VIEWS IN DJANGO
*********************************************************************************************************************************************

In Django Rest Framework (DRF), the following Concrete View Classes or Generic View Classes are provided to help speed up the development of RESTful APIs:

CreateAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to create a new object.
This view class handles POST requests and is used for creating new objects in the database. 
It is typically used with the CreateModelMixin and the SerializerMixin to serialize and validate the input data.

ListAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to list objects.
This view class handles GET requests and is used for retrieving a list of objects from the database. 
It is typically used with the ListModelMixin and the SerializerMixin to serialize the data into a specific format.

RetrieveAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to retrieve a single object.
This view class handles GET requests and is used for retrieving a single object from the database. 
It is typically used with the RetrieveModelMixin and the SerializerMixin to serialize the data into a specific format.

DestroyAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to delete an object.
This view class handles DELETE requests and is used for deleting a single object from the database.
It is typically used with the DestroyModelMixin to remove the object from the database.

UpdateAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to update an object.
This view class handles PUT and PATCH requests and is used for updating a single object in the database.
It is typically used with the UpdateModelMixin and the SerializerMixin to serialize and validate the input data.

ListCreateAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to list objects or create a new object.
This view class combines the functionality of the ListAPIView and CreateAPIView classes.
It is typically used with the ListModelMixin, CreateModelMixin, and SerializerMixin to provide both listing and creation functionalities.

RetrieveUpdateAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to retrieve a single object or update it.
This view class combines the functionality of the RetrieveAPIView and UpdateAPIView classes.
It is typically used with the RetrieveModelMixin, UpdateModelMixin, and SerializerMixin to provide both retrieving and updating functionalities.

RetrieveDestroyAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to retrieve a single object or delete it.
This view class combines the functionality of the RetrieveAPIView and DestroyAPIView classes.
It is typically used with the RetrieveModelMixin and DestroyModelMixin to provide both retrieving and deleting functionalities.

RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView: A view that provides the functionality to retrieve a single object, update it, or delete it.
This view class combines the functionality of the RetrieveAPIView, UpdateAPIView, and DestroyAPIView classes.
It is typically used with the RetrieveModelMixin, UpdateModelMixin, DestroyModelMixin, and SerializerMixin to provide all three functionalities.

In DRF, these Concrete View Classes or Generic View Classes can be further customized and extended using Mixins. 
Mixins are reusable components that provide additional functionality to the views.
For example, the CreateAPIView class can be extended with the ListMixin to provide listing functionality along with the creation functionality.
Similarly, the RetrieveAPIView class can be extended with the UpdateMixin to provide updating functionality along with the retrieving functionality.






Sure! Here are some code examples for each of the Concrete View Classes or Generic View Classes in Django Rest Framework:

CreateAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import CreateAPIView
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

class MyCreateAPIView(CreateAPIView):
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
In this example, we define a view that inherits from CreateAPIView and specifies a serializer class to be used to serialize the input data for 
creating a new object.

ListAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer
from .models import MyModel

class MyListAPIView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
In this example, we define a view that inherits from ListAPIView and specifies a queryset and serializer class to be used 
to retrieve a list of objects from the database.

RetrieveAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import RetrieveAPIView
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer
from .models import MyModel

class MyRetrieveAPIView(RetrieveAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
In this example, we define a view that inherits from RetrieveAPIView and specifies a queryset and serializer class to be used to
retrieve a single object from the database.

DestroyAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import DestroyAPIView
from .models import MyModel

class MyDestroyAPIView(DestroyAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
In this example, we define a view that inherits from DestroyAPIView and specifies a queryset to be used to delete a single object from the database.

UpdateAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import UpdateAPIView
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer
from .models import MyModel

class MyUpdateAPIView(UpdateAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
In this example, we define a view that inherits from UpdateAPIView and specifies a queryset and serializer class to be used to
update a single object in the database.

ListCreateAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import ListCreateAPIView
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer
from .models import MyModel

class MyListCreateAPIView(ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
In this example, we define a view that inherits from ListCreateAPIView and specifies a queryset and serializer class 
to be used to both retrieve a list of objects and create a new object.

RetrieveUpdateAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import RetrieveUpdateAPIView
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer
from .models import MyModel

class MyRetrieveUpdateAPIView(RetrieveUpdateAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
In this example, we define a view that inherits from RetrieveUpdateAPIView and specifies a queryset and serializer class 
to be used to both retrieve a single object and update it.

RetrieveDestroyAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import RetrieveDestroyAPIView
from .models import MyModel

class MyRetrieveDestroyAPIView(RetrieveDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
In this example, we define a view that inherits from RetrieveDestroyAPIView and specifies a queryset to be used to both retrieve
a single object and delete it.

RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView:

from rest_framework.generics import RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer
from .models

*********************************************************************************************************************************************

In Django REST framework, concrete view classes are derived by combining the GenericAPIView with one or more mixin classes django-rest-framework.org.
Mixins provide discrete functionality for model operations, while generic views handle ReSTful API and HTTP verb behavior stackoverflow.com. 
Heres how each of the requested concrete view classes is composed using mixins:

CreateAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, CreateModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP POST method. 
  This view class allows you to create new instances of a model.
ListAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, ListModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP GET method. 
  This view class allows you to list all instances of a model.
RetrieveAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, RetrieveModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP GET method with a specific instance.
  This view class allows you to retrieve a single instance of a model.
DestroyAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, DestroyModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP DELETE method.
  This view class allows you to delete a single instance of a model.
UpdateAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, UpdateModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP PUT and PATCH methods.
  This view class allows you to update a single instance of a model.
ListCreateAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, ListModelMixin, CreateModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP GET and POST methods. 
  This view class allows you to list all instances of a model and create new instances.
RetrieveUpdateAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, RetrieveModelMixin, UpdateModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP GET, PUT,
  and PATCH methods with a specific instance. This view class allows you to retrieve and update a single instance of a model.
RetrieveDestroyAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, RetrieveModelMixin, DestroyModelMixin, and maps to the HTTP GET and 
  DELETE methods with a specific instance. This view class allows you to retrieve and delete a single instance of a model.
RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView: Combines GenericAPIView, RetrieveModelMixin, UpdateModelMixin, DestroyModelMixin, and
  maps to the HTTP GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods with a specific instance. This view class allows you to retrieve,
  update, and delete a single instance of a model.
In summary, each of these concrete view classes is a combination of the GenericAPIView and one or more mixin classes,
which together provide the desired functionality for handling common CRUD operations on models django-rest-framework.org.



Here are code samples demonstrating the use of the concrete view classes mentioned earlier:

CreateAPIView:
from rest_framework.generics import CreateAPIView
from .models import MyModel
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
    
    
    
ListAPIView:
  
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
from .models import MyModel
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

class MyModelListAPIView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
    
    
    
    
RetrieveAPIView:
  
from rest_framework.generics import RetrieveAPIView
from .models import MyModel
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

class MyModelRetrieveAPIView(RetrieveAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()

from .models import MyModel
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

class MyModelUpdateAPIView(UpdateAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
    
    
    
ListCreateAPIView:
  
from rest_framework.generics import ListCreateAPIView

from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

class MyModelRetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView(RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
    
    
These examples demonstrate how each concrete view class can be used for common CRUD operations in a Django REST framework application.
You can customize these views further by overriding methods, adding additional mixins, or implementing your own logic django-rest-framework.org.








HERE IS MORE EXPLANATION
*********************************************************************************************************************************************

Here are some code samples for using concrete view classes in Django REST framework123:

To create a view that allows creating and listing users, you can use the CreateAPIView and ListAPIView classes:
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAdminUser
from .serializers import UserSerializer

class UserListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAdminUser]
To create a view that allows retrieving, updating, and deleting a user, you can use the RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView class:
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAdminUser
from .serializers import UserSerializer

class UserDetailView(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAdminUser]
To create a view that allows listing and creating samples of a model, you can use the ListCreateAPIView class:
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import SampleModel
from .serializers import SampleSerializer

class SampleListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = SampleModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SampleSerializer
To create a view that allows retrieving, updating, and deleting a sample of a model, you can use the RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView class:
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import SampleModel
from .serializers import SampleSerializer

class SampleDetailView(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = SampleModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SampleSerializer
To create a custom view that combines different mixins with the base GenericAPIView class, you can do something like this:
from rest_framework import generics, mixins
from .models import CustomModel
from .serializers import CustomSerializer

class CustomView(generics.GenericAPIView,
                 mixins.ListModelMixin,
                 mixins.CreateModelMixin,
                 mixins.UpdateModelMixin):
    queryset = CustomModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = CustomSerializer

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.list(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.update(request, *args, **kwargs)
These are some examples of how to use concrete view classes in Django REST framework.
You can also refer to the documentation12 or some tutorials3 for more details and examples.
