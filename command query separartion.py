Command-Query Separation (CQS) is a principle that suggests separating operations that modify state (commands)
from operations that return information (queries). While Django doesnt enforce CQS explicitly, 
you can apply the principle in your Django project to improve code organization and maintainability.

Here are some guidelines to apply CQS in Django:

Commands:

Commands represent operations that modify state, such as creating, updating, or deleting data.
Use Django's Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture to organize your code.
Place command-related logic in views or viewsets.
Use Django forms or serializers for data validation and processing.
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to keep your commands focused on a specific task.


Queries:

Queries represent operations that retrieve information from the system, typically through database queries.
Use Django's QuerySet API to perform database queries and retrieve data.
Place query-related logic in views or viewsets, separate from command logic.
Utilize Django's ORM features like filters, annotations, and aggregations to construct complex queries.
Consider using Django's template system or serializers to format and present query results.
Separation:

Clearly separate command logic from query logic by dividing them into separate functions, methods, or classes.
Avoid mixing command and query logic within the same function or method.
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to ensure that each function or method has a clear purpose.
By applying CQS in Django, you can improve the readability, testability, and maintainability of your codebase.
It helps to isolate the concerns of modifying state and retrieving information, making your code more modular and easier to understand and maintain.
