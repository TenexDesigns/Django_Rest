 Rukham Khan 3 May 2023

Are you looking for the best SMTP service provider to manage your transactional emails? You came to the right place.

Your email delivery rate plays an important role in the success of your email marketing. If you don’t hit your customers’ inbox every time, your sales take a hit.

In this article, I’ll be walking you through:

The best SMTP service providers that you can use to scale your email marketing
The definition and importance of SMTP servers
How to set up your own SMTP server and more
So, even if this is your first time hearing about SMTP, you will be up to speed by the time you finish reading this article. Let’s dive in. 

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

What is an SMTP server?
An SMTP server is the application and hardware that sends your email messages. It acts as a ‘middleman’ between you and the receiver of your emails.

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a set of guidelines and procedures for sending emails.

Why do you need an SMTP server?
Let me put it this way, without an SMTP server, your email messages won’t get to your recipients. 

There are generally two types of emails you send out to your customers:

Bulk emails are the emails you send to a large segment of your customers at once. They include email marketing and advertising emails. 
Transactional emails are automated emails your customers receive when they take specific actions. They include password reset emails, order confirmation emails, legal update emails, and so on. These are important and need to be delivered fast and without trouble.
Your own website or eCommerce platform might also send an email. If it uses the PHP Mail function, that can be a problem. It doesn’t guarantee high deliverability.

Also, there is a huge chance that you use a shared web server that may be flagged as suspicious. This could have a negative impact on your sending reputation.

Use an SMTP server instead. This way, you’ll have the proper authentication that will make sure that your emails get to your customer’s inbox.

Benefits of an SMTP server
SMTP may be a new concept to you and you must be thinking; “What’s in it for me?” Here are three reasons why you should consider using an SMTP server.

Improve your email deliverability
Track and maintain reports on the performance of your emails
Send out bulk emails
1. Improve your email deliverability
This is the biggest advantage of using an SMTP server. There is no point in sending out emails if they are only going to end up in your recipient’s spam folder. That’s a waste of marketing resources.

SMTP relay servers make sure that your emails land in your customer’s inbox, reliably and on time.

Most SMTP service providers promise deliverability of over 98%. You worry less about whether your emails get to their destination. And focus more on driving the right actions from your recipients.

2. Track and maintain reports on the performance of your emails
A good email marketing strategy includes the ability to measure the effectiveness of your emails. You want to be up to speed on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as bounce rate, open rate, unsubscribe rate, click-through rate, and so on.

An SMTP server measures these metrics. It tracks your emails from the moment you send them till they get delivered to your recipients. With the information from these KPIs, you can shape your marketing tactics.

3. Sending bulk emails
Sending bulk emails is the best way to reach a huge number of your customers. But the cost of sending these emails can quickly pile up.

One way to make sure you don’t break the bank when bulk emailing is to use an email relay server. This is a cost-effective approach you should consider if you send out a lot of emails monthly.

Free or premium: which SMTP server do you need?
We all love free things, don’t we? Getting value for your business without spending a dime is amazing.

Except there are usually limitations that will stifle your business growth unless you upgrade to premium plans. But premium isn’t an excuse to spend a lot of money. Measure the value from the premium product against its cost, and identify a clear path toward positive ROI. So, which SMTP server does your business need?

A free server is the best choice for you if you’re starting or are on a limited budget. It’s also recommended that you don’t send out a lot of emails.

Most SMTP relay providers offer a free pricing tier. Usually, there is a cap on the number of emails you can send monthly.

Mailersend, for example, allows you to send up to 12,000 emails per month. Amazon SES sets its limit at 62,000 emails (there’s a catch which you’ll find out later in the article). You can generally send between 3,000 to 6,000 emails per month using a free SMTP server.

But as your business grows, you’ll find out that your email marketing needs exceed a free server’s capacity. Then you need to rely on scalable SMTP service from your service provider as you transition from free to premium server.

A premium server is best for businesses with large mailing lists. A free server won’t cut it if you need to send tens of thousands or even millions of messages per month.

Also, you should consider paying for a premium email server if you want to unlock special features from your service provider.

In my roundup of the best SMTP platforms below, I’ll focus on relay service providers that offer the best free SMTP server solution.

How does sending email through SMTP work?
The technical process of sending emails isn’t as simple as you might think.

Here is a simple breakdown of the route your email takes. And what an SMTP relay server does to get your emails delivered.

Once you hit send, your email is transferred to a relay server via an SMTP port. Different ports are used for this connection but the most popular ones are port 25, port 465, port 587, and port 2525.
Once the connection between your email client (Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, etc) and the server is completed, an SMTP session starts.
The SMTP server receives your email’s content and attachments. It assesses you and your recipient’s email addresses.
If you and the recipient belong to the same domain name, the email is sent directly to the recipient via the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
If not, the MTA interacts with the Domain Name System and receives the IP address of your recipient’s email server.
Then your SMTP server connects with your recipient’s server and transfers the email.
If the recipient’s server isn’t available, the email will be put in a backup server or added back into the SMTP queue. The email server will make periodic delivery attempts until it’s successful. If delivery is aborted, the email is sent back to the sender with a notification.

How to set up an SMTP server
Using a hosted relay service provider isn’t the only way to send emails. Another route you can take is to build your SMTP server.

Wondering if you can build a functional SMTP server from scratch? Well, you shouldn’t. There are several open-source SMTP server solutions built to help you get your server off the ground.

Some of these solutions include SendMail SMTP, PostFix SMTP, hMailServer, and iRedMail. I’ll focus on how to set up your dedicated SMTP server using hMailServer.

But before we dive into that, let’s make sure that you understand what it means (and takes) to launch your server. Here are 3 questions you should ask yourself before you make that decision.

Three questions to ask yourself before setting up your SMTP server
1. How many emails will I send out monthly?
The hard truth is the more emails you send per month, the less profitable it is to keep running your local server. So it is important to figure out how many emails you’ll be sending out monthly.

Email deliverability should be at the top of your mind when choosing any SMTP server solution. As the volume of your emails increases, deliverability becomes an issue.

It’s difficult to maintain a good sender reputation as email providers are generally suspicious of local SMTP servers.

2. Do I have the necessary knowledge to set up my SMTP infrastructure?
Setting up an SMTP server involves more than just installing software and providing a few required details. you’re betting the success of your email marketing campaign on the infrastructure. So you have to make sure that you get it right.

To give yourself a solid foundation, understand the following concepts behind the installation of SMTP servers.

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and its best practices
Mail-Transfer-Agent (MTA)
Advanced knowledge of the workings of various ISPs available
Knowledge of Domain-based Message Authentication (DMARC) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to protect your email infrastructure
And many more.
Hosted SMTP relay services are popular because they take care of things you’d rather not spend your time doing. These things include: 

managing your email deliverability 
monitoring the blacklists 
monitoring your IP addresses, and so on.
If you’re going to build an SMTP server, then you should make sure that you or another team member is confident with these concepts.

3. How much time will I realistically spend on the SMTP server?
Setting up a server takes time. You could spend long hours, days, or weeks on it. And as I already mentioned, it isn’t a scalable solution. You can save time by using an SMTP relay service to manage your server operations.

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, let’s look at how to set up your SMTP server using hMailServer.

How to set up your SMTP server using hMailServer
hMailServer is a powerful open-source tool for launching your email server on Microsoft Windows.

Follow the following steps to configure and run your SMTP server.

Download and install hMailServer on your computer to get started. Click here to get the latest version of hMailServer software.
Open the software and follow the installation dialogue until you get to the select components window. Check to make sure that server and administrative tools are selected.
At the next window, decide which database you want hMailServer to use. Your two options are a built-in database engine and an external database engine. If you want to send out test emails, select the built-in database engine.
hMailServer will create an administrator’s account for you. Secure it with a password. This is the password you’ll use to manage your hMailServer installation and make future changes.
You should be at the end of the installation process now. Click install and run hMailServer.
The following steps will show you how to configure hMailServer.

Click on connect and enter the password you created during the installation process.
Click on add domain, input your domain name, and save. If you’re building the server to test emails, you can provide a fake domain name.
Select the accounts folder and click add. Here, enter your account name and set your password. Click save when you’re done.
Expand settings on the left tab and click on protocols. Since what we want is an SMTP server, uncheck POP3 and IMAP boxes.
Expand advanced and input localhost under your default domain server. Click Save.
Under advanced, click auto-ban and uncheck the enable box.
This is the last step. Expand utilities and click on diagnostics. Choose the domain you entered earlier. The tests we are concerned about are collecting server details and testing outbound ports. These must be marked green.
If you follow these steps, you’ll have your STMP server.

How to connect your SMTP server to your WordPress website
WordPress uses the PHP Mail function to send emails by default. But you don’t have to stick to it. It is possible to change your WordPress configuration to SMTP.

To do this, you’ll have to install a WordPress plugin called WP Mail SMTP. What this plugin does is change the WP mail function to either use the standard SMTP credentials. Or take advantage of built-in SMTP mail providers. Some of the built-in SMTP mail providers are SMTP.com, Sendinblue, SendGrid, Gmail, Microsoft, Amazon SES, Zoho Mail.

Here’s how you connect your email server to your WordPress website using the WP Mail SMTP.

The first thing you do is to install WP Mail SMTP. Once this plugin is installed and activated, you’ll notice a new menu (WP Mail SMTP) show up under settings. Scroll over to this menu and click on it.

On the new page, you’ll find a few configuration settings available. Here’s what they mean.

From email: This is the email address you want to send your emails from. It’s the one you registered with your SMTP service provider.
From name: This lets your recipients know where the email is from. You should use your website’s name here.
Mailer: WP Mail SMTP allows you to choose from a pool of built-in email relay service providers. Or select the Other SMTP option if your provider isn’t listed. Email service providers like Gmail, SendGrid, and SMTP.com need you to provide extra information such as API key and client ID. 
Return path: This is to specify if you want your email’s return path to be the same as sending the emails.
If you choose the other SMTP option, you’ll be asked to provide the server’s configuration setting. This is how to go about that.

SMTP host: This is your server’s hostname. It usually follows the format smtp.yourserver.com
Encryption: Choose whether you have SSL or TSL encryption available.
SMTP port: This is the port your server works on. It is set to 465 by default.
Authentication: Your SMTP server should require authentication. Turn it on.
SMTP username: This is the username you provided to your service provider.
SMTP password: Input your SMTP server password.
Click on save settings once you’re done entering all the parameters.

That’s how you connect your server to your WordPress website. To confirm if you have done a good job, head over to the email test tab. Enter the address you want to send the test email to and click send mail. Check your inbox to confirm if WP Mail SMTP sent the email to you.
