In the context of Django REST framework, a RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is an API that follows the principles of
REST architecture. REST is a set of design principles for creating APIs that are scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain.

A RESTful API is designed around resources, which are typically represented by URLs. Each resource can be accessed
using a specific HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE), which corresponds to a specific action on the resource.
For example, a GET request to a resource URL would retrieve the current state of that resource, 
while a PUT request to the same URL would update that resource with new data.

RESTful APIs also use HTTP status codes to indicate the result of an API request. 
For example, a successful GET request might return a status code of 200 (OK), while an unsuccessful request might return a 404 (Not Found)
or a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.

Django REST framework provides a set of tools and patterns that make it easy to create RESTful APIs. 
For example, DRF provides viewsets and routers that map URLs to CRUD operations on a resource, and serializers that convert data to and from Python objects.

Overall, RESTful APIs are a popular choice for building modern web applications because they are scalable, flexible, and easy to use.
They also make it easy to create APIs that can be consumed by a wide range of clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other third-party applications.
